## üîç Project Overview

This project allows users to query complex administrative documents‚Äîlike the CalWORKs CSA‚Äîfor specific information on:

- Demographics and community profiles
- Housing affordability and poverty indicators
- Eligibility and program services
- Client engagement and partner collaboration
- System barriers and policy recommendations

The system uses OpenAI embeddings + Milvus for vector search and GPT-4 to generate concise, accurate answers.
