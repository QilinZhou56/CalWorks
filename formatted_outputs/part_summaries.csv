Introduction,Introduction,3,5,"The CalWORKs County Self-Assessment (Cal-CSA) report was managed by a team with extensive experience in county administration, CalWORKs, and Welfare-to-Work (WTW) programs. The team's goal was to establish a data-driven program management system for continuous improvement of county CalWORKs programs. 

To gather feedback, the team established five focus groups, consisting of educational partners, specialized services providers, caseworkers, EQUUS Workforce Solutions, and CW/WTW Administrators. Data from a five-month Client Satisfaction Survey was also utilized. 

The team worked to ensure a community-focused approach by seeking and incorporating feedback from various partners and collaborators. Focus group participants expressed enjoyment in being consulted for potential program improvements and looking forward to seeing new implementations related to their feedback. 

The team also planned for the CalWORKs System Improvement Plan (Cal-SIP), where they aim to establish small cohorts of current and former clients to better understand barriers and challenges from their perspective. 

The report indicates efforts to educate stakeholders about the Cal-OAR and the continuous quality improvement (CQI) process, emphasizing the multi-dimensional nature of CWWTW that requires an understanding of how services are delivered to vulnerable families. 

Overall, the report indicates a shift towards a more data-driven, community-focused, and participatory approach to service delivery in the CalWORKs program in the county."
Demographics,Demographics,6,18,"The report provides a detailed analysis of the demographics and trends in the CalWORKs program in Orange County, Southern California. Orange County residents have higher education attainment levels than the state average, however, many CalWORKs clients end up with minimum wage jobs or working for a temporary job-placement agency due to the high cost of living and rent prices in the county. 

Unemployment rates in Orange County were lower than California's in both 2019 (2.8% vs 5.2%) and 2021 (6.0% vs 7.3%). The county also has higher proportions of residents with a bachelor's or graduate degree compared to the state average. However, affordable housing options in the county remain scarce, with a minimum wage worker needing to work over 100 hours a week to afford a one-bedroom apartment. 

The report highlights the diversity of the county with a significant Asian and Latino population, although the Asian category encompasses multiple communities including Vietnamese, Korean, and Chinese residents. 

The CalWORKs program faces challenges including the high cost of living, limited public transportation options, and a lack of digital literacy among clients. There is also a need for services to support educational attainment, wage progression, housing support, and English language learning. 

The report concludes by identifying emerging employment sectors including the computer, construction, biomedical, health, and business and professional services industries. These sectors have seen significant growth and offer potential opportunities for CalWORKs clients."
Section 1. Agency Characteristics,Part 1. Service Utilization and Access,19,26,"The report provides an overview of the CalWORKs programâ€™s operations, service delivery, and organizational structure within the county. The Family Self-Sufficiency & Adult Services (FSS-AS) Division oversees the administration of CalWORKs and other related services. They collaborate with various stakeholders to ensure vulnerable families achieve self-sufficiency.

The report highlights the implementation of the Welfare-To-Work (WTW) Program, which is designed to support families working towards self-sufficiency. The CalWORKs offices are spread across different regions in the county to ensure accessibility, including Santa Ana, Anaheim, Cypress, and Laguna Hills. However, one site is temporarily closed for repairs and renovations until December 2023.

A key shift in service delivery is the adoption of a caseload-based service delivery system, including the introduction of the CalWORKs 2.0 framework. The framework allows for a more flexible approach to service delivery, considering the specific circumstances and needs of the whole family. Other initiatives include the No Wrong Door and First Contact Resolution, aimed at removing barriers and providing efficient services.

There are also language support measures in place to assist non-English speaking clients. The county employs a public-private model for case management and employment services, collaborating with contracted staff to cater to caseload and language needs. Employment & Eligibility Specialists (EESs) are available to assist clients from Monday to Friday.

The report acknowledges the potential disconnect between line and administration staff due to the agency's size and structure. However, it also outlines the advantages of this structure, such as strong administrative support and the opportunity for staff rotations and professional growth.

Past changes that impacted the CalWORKs program include the implementation of the Early Engagement initiative and the Client Engagement System (CES) in 2015 and 2014 respectively, which aimed to improve client engagement and collaboration. The Mutual Client (MC) project was introduced in 2018 to streamline services for eligible families. The report also mentions the adaptation to the COVID-19 public health emergency and the implementation of protective measures in 2020."
Section 1. Agency Characteristics,Part 2. County Offices,27,29,"The report highlights the county offices of CalWORKs and the services they offer. These offices are mostly located in urban areas with a high concentration of poverty. CalWORKs North, East, South, West, and a Foster Care Regional Center are strategically located near major highways and areas with the highest poverty rates. These offices offer Welfare-to-Work (WTW) services, and other co-located agencies. Services include public health nursing, legal assistance, accounting, and family resource centers that are available on site one day a week. 

The report also discusses the geographic dispersion of poverty within the county. It indicates that the northern half of Orange County has a higher concentration of poverty compared to the southern half. The overall poverty rate in Orange County is 10.10%. The locations of the CalWORKs offices mirror the dispersion of poverty, with four of the five offices located in the northern half of the county. 

In terms of service access, some of the offices have temporarily closed for repairs. However, the CalWORKs program continues to provide services to clients living in different areas of Orange County, with offices near major highways for easy reach. The report does not provide specific performance metrics or population trends but indicates that the offices are located in areas where the services are most needed. The eligibility and Welfare-to-Work (WTW) services are co-located, and the use of call centers was mentioned."
Section 1. Agency Characteristics,Part 3. Staff Functions & Workforce,30,31,"CalWORKs applications are assigned to Intake Employment and Eligibility Specialists (IEES) on a round-robin basis, with considerations for language barriers and specialized service needs. Applications are processed immediately if they identify immediate need, expedited services, or homeless assistance needs. Specialized units, like the Domestic Abuse Services Unit and Housing Support Program, are available for particular needs. After approval, applications are transferred to their respective continuing sections for ongoing maintenance. 

The report also provides information on various specialized caseload units and their usage across county offices. The Domestic Abuse Caseload Unit serves 145 caseloads, the Mutual Client Unit serves 154 caseloads, the Refugee Unit serves 5 caseloads, and the Cal-Learn Unit serves 49 caseloads. 

For training, case managers and employment & eligibility specialists undergo comprehensive training programs, the Welfare-to-Work IIT and the CalWORKs & CalFresh IIT training course, respectively. These programs include policy, procedure, and business process reviews, along with shadowing and mentoring. Training and Career Development (TCD) team provides onboarding experiences for new employees to ensure proficiency in job tasks. They are then paired with mentors for hands-on training and have the opportunity to attend refresher courses."
Section 1. Agency Characteristics,Part 4. Partnerships,32,33,"The report reveals several key trends and challenges in the delivery of CalWORKs services. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a shift in candidate expectations towards more flexible, remote jobs, making eligibility and case management roles less attractive. This is posing a challenge for the program, which requires high-volume, in-person services. 

The Agency has also been facing high staff turnover rates due to retirements, promotions, and resignations over the past five years. This turnover is affecting the stability and institutional knowledge within the workforce. Hiring and retaining staff has been a challenge due to the time it takes to hire and an increase in candidates declining job offers or not showing up for interviews.

Skill gaps are also a concern, with employers struggling to hire people with the right skills and existing employees having outdated skills. Current and previous partnerships have helped to add more staff, training, and technology resources to the programs.

Regular meetings with various boards and educational institutions have provided the Agency with alternative perspectives and collaboration opportunities. Contracted service providers have helped clients utilize more diverse resources. However, the turnover of these providers based on Request For Proposal guidelines and government contracting requirements can be disruptive and impact the level of service. 

Potential future partnerships with Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) could improve outcomes for clients by providing more skills and interviewing training. However, limited opportunities for living wage jobs may be impacting clients' motivation to participate in job activities. The Agency is looking to better align and standardize some processes with contracted partners to improve service delivery."
Section 1. Agency Characteristics,Part 5. Financial/Material Resources,34,38,"The CalWORKs county report identified several key trends, service changes, and quantitative outcomes relating to program delivery. 

1. Caseworkers identified the need for a less complicated Child Care application process, with the potential integration of DocuSign to expedite the process.
  
2. There is a need for a clearer delineation of services for each CalWORKs/Work Training and Welfare (CW/WTW) caseworker to reduce miscommunication and prevent client confusion.
  
3. Preliminary Cal-OAR data analysis revealed lower performance for non-English speakers. An opportunity to further study this gap in service has been identified.

4. The agency will explore additional subsidized and vocational training opportunities to increase employment activities.

5. A significant gap in services was identified in relation to Work Training and Welfare (WTW) eligibility for undocumented adults, resulting in a lack of exposure to work opportunities.

6. The agency uses several funding sources, including Title IV-E, Medi-Cal, Title 19, State Realignment, and others, to support the CWD and impact services provided to the CalWORKs population.

7. The agency plans to link clients from child welfare programs to expand services available to the CalWORKs population based on mutual eligibility.

8. Fluctuations in CalWORKs allocations have made it difficult for the agency to adapt quickly to changes and develop a core foundation of services. 

9. Increased utilization of Family Stabilization was credited to efforts in reaching more eligible populations.

10. The agency experienced difficulty fully expending certain allocations due to challenges created by COVID-19, including good cause waivers, stay-at-home orders, expanded safety net programs, and capacity constraints.

11. The utilization of Housing Support Program (HSP) and Home Visiting Program (HVP) allocations varied across fiscal years due to factors such as late issuance of funds and client concerns about home visits during a public health emergency.

12. The agency encourages CDSS to allow for multi-year allocations, when possible, to give CWDs more time to plan and deploy funding across various supportive services."
Section 2. Partner and Collaborator Engagement and Feedback,Part 1. Overall Partner and Collaborator Engagement,39,44,"The report indicates an increase in engagement and collaboration among CalWORKs partners and stakeholders, with regular focus group sessions and meetings. The Cal-OAR team has formed a cohort of current and former CalWORKs clients who are interested in giving feedback on the program. This engagement has been facilitated by Shared Vision Consultants (SVC). 

Focus group participants have generally been employed in the field for multiple years and have commended the agency's efforts to improve relationships with them. The participants described the agency as ""open to feedback"" and willing to work with partners to solve problems. 

However, several challenges have been noted. Students transitioning from community colleges to four-year programs do not have transitional support. Students also face significant challenges such as domestic violence, substance abuse, lack of childcare, housing instability, and psychological stresses. 

The report indicates that the client referral process needs to be revised with a focus on the client's needs and goals. Frequent changes of case managers due to transfers, promotions, or retirements is a challenge for clients. Transportation and reliable childcare are significant obstacles to maintaining employment and housing stability. 

The report also shows a trend where clients generally ""do better when they can choose to participate in a program or service than when assigned."" It also reveals that clients with external family support and prior work experience seem to be the most successful. 

The focus group for case managers identified barriers to engaging clients in educational activities, such as lack of motivation, self-confidence, domestic/substance abuse, learning/physical/mental disability, homelessness, and lack of childcare education. 

The report also indicates that the main reasons clients return to the CalWORKs program after exiting are the lack of retention services, including housing, mileage, and lack of safety net after obtaining full-time employment. 

Lastly, the report shows that existing partnerships benefit everyone, with solid communication and clear expectations. However, there is a gap in the collaboration and services provided, and these should be expanded to non-WTW populations such as undocumented persons and children."
Section 2. Partner and Collaborator Engagement and Feedback,Part 2. Client Experience,45,45,"The 'Client Experience' section of the CalWORKs county report emphasizes the need for further analysis of Initial and Ongoing Engagement performance measures based on feedback from focus groups. The report suggests that focus on these measures could enhance goal achievement and barrier mitigation, particularly through improvements in barrier removal processes, client-case manager relationships, and the understanding and utilization of child care and transportation authorifications. These improvements are expected to increase Orientation Attendance Rate and Engagement Rate.

Survey data indicates that 72% of participants felt their time at the office was valued, while 16% disagreed with this statement. Average wait times at regional offices are approximately 20 minutes. 

According to the CDSS Client Satisfaction Survey, Orange County received 75 responses between July and November 2022. Of the respondents, 80% felt welcomed at the office, and 78% believed they received consistent information from the county throughout their participation in the WTW program. 

The report identified the tracking of referrals as an area for potential improvement."
Section 2. Partner and Collaborator Engagement and Feedback,Part 3. Client Satisfaction Survey,46,46,"The analysis of the 'Part 3. Client Satisfaction Survey' section of the CalWORKs county report reveals several key trends, although there is limited data available. Over a period of five months, the agency received 75 responses to the Client Satisfaction Survey. However, each question only received an average of 19 to 32 responses, which the Cal-OAR Team indicated was insufficient to make definitive conclusions. 

The reasons families apply for CalWORKs are primarily due to financial hardships, which can include unemployment and underemployment, as well as disability needs, homelessness and housing issues, lack of healthcare, and other related emergency situations. These influences suggest a trend of usage of the CalWORKs program as a safety net for families facing various types of socio-economic crises.

There's no explicit mention of service shifts, access barriers, or performance metrics. The report also does not provide information about client outreach methods beyond the survey, such as focus groups.

Overall, the information gathered from the survey does not appear to have significantly influenced the county measure analysis, given the limited data available from the survey."
Section 3. Barrier Removal Services,Part 1. Key Data,47,47,"The CalWORKs county report displays trends and outcomes for people who have been recommended for various Barrier Removal Services. These include services for domestic abuse, substance abuse, and mental health issues. On average, the most referrals were made for domestic abuse services (156 per month), followed by mental health services (135 per month), and substance abuse services (13 per month). 

Among those referred for Domestic Abuse Services, an average of 44 individuals per month have an exemption, good cause, or program waiver. A smaller number, an average of 8 per month, are receiving these services through the Family Stabilization program. No individuals were reported as receiving Homeless Assistance or Housing Support Program services alongside Domestic Abuse Services.

In the case of Substance Abuse Services, an average of one individual per month has an exemption, good cause, or program waiver. No individuals receiving these services were reported as receiving support from the Family Stabilization program or the Homeless Assistance or Housing Support Program services.

For Mental Health Services, an average of 47 individuals per month have an exemption, good cause, or program waiver and an average of 18 individuals per month are receiving these services through the Family Stabilization program. Again, no individuals were reported as receiving Homeless Assistance or Housing Support Program services alongside Mental Health Services.

Data regarding the average monthly number of individuals that completed the Learning Needs Screening, the average monthly number of referrals generated for Learning Needs Evaluation, and the average monthly number of individuals that waived the Learning Needs Screening was not applicable during the 2021-2026 Cal-OAR cycle."
Section 3. Barrier Removal Services,Part 2. Service Utilization and Access,48,50,"The report discusses trends and services related to CalWORKs in a county, with a focus on barrier removal and service utilization. The agency provides various services for mental health, substance abuse, domestic abuse, legal assistance, public health, family stabilization, housing support, family assessment, childcare, and a home visiting program. These services are made available through various methods such as good cause/waiver orientation, appraisal, and intake packets.

The Family Support Assessment (FSA) Process monitors families for up to 12 months, tracking the number of families serviced, types of barriers, services provided, length of time before exiting the FSA, and the reason for exiting. The agency is working on addressing family needs gaps, particularly focusing on whole family support rather than just those engaging for Welfare to Work (WTW) participation. 

However, there are challenges faced by families with non-citizen members who do not receive services and benefits at the same level as the general CalWORKs population. Similarly, the agency faces challenges with the impact of Latino immigrants, prompting the hiring of a bilingual and bicultural workforce.

For clients co-involved with child welfare, a collaboration known as Mutual Client (MC) has shown success in meeting the needs of these families through a streamlined approach. Recent contract agreements like Case Management Services (CMS) and Integrated Job Services (IJS) have also been aligned with Cal-OAR reporting requirements. 

There is an identified unmet need for post-aid services. To address this, starting from January 2023, the agency will offer post-aid services through Employment Services - Post-Aid Supportive Services (ES-PASS). ES-PASS will identify the needs of former CWWTW participants and provide resources to overcome barriers to self-sufficiency."
Section 3. Barrier Removal Services,"Part 3. Offer of Services, Barrier Identification, and Referral Process",51,56,"The CalWORKs report discusses key trends in service provision, barrier identification, and referral processes. It notes the importance of barrier removal services, which are discussed and offered from the initial client interview and throughout the client's interaction with the agency. The information gathered during interviews is confidential and crucial for evaluating family needs and removing barriers.

The report also identifies gaps in OCAT recommendations for services and referrals, mainly due to clients' refusal or decline of services based on their belief that they don't need them. These gaps are addressed through frequent follow-ups and reminders of available services, as well as through the distribution of informational flyers and brochures at regional offices and in application packets.

Referral processes are also outlined, with Intake Employment and Eligibility Specialists responsible for identifying barriers and offering suitable services. Case managers follow up with clients regularly to ensure their needs are being met and any grievances are appropriately addressed. In cases of domestic abuse or destabilizing crises, referrals are made to specialized case managers or units.

The report also discusses the implementation of the Family Support Team (FST) and Family Support Assessment (FSA), aimed at providing a holistic approach to assisting families. This approach includes assessing family needs, coordinating services, following up on referrals and next steps, monitoring progress, and measuring outcomes.

Lastly, the report discusses measures taken to ensure the safety of survivors of domestic abuse, including the provision of informational brochures, use of the Safe at Home (SAH) program, and maintaining strict confidentiality."
Section 3. Barrier Removal Services,Part 4. Working with Service Providers,57,61,"The CalWORKs county report reveals several trends, changes, and outcomes in service delivery for the children and families served by the program. The primary service providers were listed as OC Health Care Agency (HCA), EQUUS, MAXIMUS, MECCA, First 5, 1736 Family Crisis Center, Family Resource Center (FRC), and Orange County Asian Pacific Community Alliance (OCAPICA), among others. These providers offer a range of services including mental health and substance abuse services, job readiness training, family stabilization, and housing support.

However, the Housing Support Program (HSP) is identified as the only impacted service due to a lack of landlords willing to lease to CalWORKs clients. The report indicates that co-located barrier removal service providers are available at all CWD offices, offering assistance with medical, developmental, emotional, pregnancy, or substance use-related concerns, and domestic abuse services.

The report also outlines the leveraging of county-administered programs and community partnerships for barrier removal services. These include the OC Health Care Agency, Family Resource Centers, Integrated Job Services, Children and Family Services, and workforce development boards. The report mentions the collaboration with other county agencies and partners to streamline services and identify additional resources.

Despite these efforts, the report identifies some barriers to access, such as local housing prioritization rules that prevent CalWORKs clients in the HSP from being considered for ongoing long-term housing opportunities like Section 8 housing vouchers. 

Overall, the report highlights an integrated and coordinated approach to service delivery, with various agencies and service providers working together to address the diverse needs of CalWORKs clients. However, the challenges related to housing for CalWORKs clients points to a need for further efforts to remove barriers to service access."
Section 3. Barrier Removal Services,Part 5. Staff Training,62,64,"The report discusses various specialized units within CalWORKs, including Domestic Abuse Services Units (DASU), Family Stabilization (FS) Specialized Units, Mutual Client Specialized Units, and Cal-Learn Specialized Units. These units focus on addressing specific barriers and ensuring stability for families, with services tailored to situations such as domestic abuse, mental health issues, substance abuse, and homelessness.

Staff training is highlighted as an essential aspect of service delivery in these units. Training includes domestic abuse, substance abuse, mental health, and learning disabilities, focusing on early identification of issues and sensitive communication. The training is provided in-house and also in collaboration with partner agencies.

In addition to training, staff have access to the Employee Assistance Program to manage secondary trauma and compassion fatigue. Specialized caseworkers also receive additional training on how to talk with clients about barrier removal services and making appropriate referrals.

The report also notes a shift towards intensive case management and a focus on individual assessments to determine a participant's capacity for participation in Welfare to Work (WTW) activities. This points to a trend towards personalized service delivery to address unique needs of each participant.

Overall, the report suggests a move towards specialization in service delivery, with more targeted interventions for distinct populations and barriers. This approach is expected to lead to more effective outcomes, though specific quantitative outcomes are not discussed in the provided text."
Section 4. Initial Engagement Analysis,Part 1. Initial Engagement Analysis,65,66,"The Initial Engagement Analysis for CalWORKs in Orange County reveals a few key trends and outcomes. The First Activity Attendance Rate was higher than the statewide average, peaking at 82.7% in August 2021. From April to September 2021, this rate trended upward, unlike the state's rate, which dipped and then slightly increased. 

The OCAT/Appraisal Timeliness Rate and the Orientation Attendance Rate were also higher than the statewide averages. The OCAT/Appraisal Timeliness Rate increased and then dropped slightly below the initial rate from July to December 2021. The Orientation Attendance Rate, however, trended downward from July to December 2021, in contrast to the state rate, which trended upward. 

Several factors contributed to these trends. The county agency enhanced access to virtual orientations, OCAT/Appraisal Interviews, online activities, and e-forms in response to COVID-19, which likely facilitated these increases. However, clients faced barriers such as the struggle to find reliable child care, overwhelming paperwork, and lack of access to technology for virtual services. 

Transportation access was noted as a primary concern, with most clients using cars and facing challenges if they live in remote areas. In response, alternative transportation methods like Uber/Lyft were offered on a case-by-case basis. The county also implemented the Early Engagement Project in 2016 to improve business processes and close gaps between CalWORKs approvals, Welfare-To-Work case assignment, and scheduling of Orientation and Appraisal Interviews. Despite these efforts, issues like complex family needs, housing instability, and lack of reliable child care remain as primary concerns for meeting Initial Engagement goals."
Section 4. Initial Engagement Analysis,Part 2. Demographic Analysis,67,68,"The CalWORKs report indicates that while early engagement practices have been successful in ensuring immediate initial engagement in WTW (Welfare-To-Work) activities, there are still gaps in service due to barriers such as transportation, childcare, and a need for holistic family assessments. There's also room for improvement in communication between case managers, contracted staff, and clients. 

The report also notes a disparity in the OCAT/Appraisal Completion Timeliness Rates among clients whose primary languages are Spanish and other languages, with rates lower than the aggregate six-month rate. However, no disparities were observed when analyzing data by age, case type, race/ethnicity, or WTW program status. 

In terms of service availability across different CW/WTW offices, the report suggests that variations may exist based on capacity and the needs of the population served, but no known disparities in service provision were identified. 

To address these issues, the Cal-OAR Team plans to continue exploring systemic causes of disparities and develop strategies to address them throughout the Cal-CQI process. Additionally, further assessments will be conducted to compare services offered by the agency and those available in the community, and to investigate if disparities exist among various measures and subpopulations. 

Overall, the report suggests a need for improved accessibility and service provision, particularly for clients facing barriers to engagement and those whose primary language is not English. Despite these challenges, the agency's proactive approach to scheduling and engaging clients in initial WTW activities has produced above-average outcomes."
Section 4. Initial Engagement Analysis,Part 3. Outcome Analysis,69,69,"The report focuses on the goal of the agency to reduce disparities and provide equitable services to all populations. They aim to empower communities and ensure equal outcomes. To achieve this, the Cal-OAR team is consistently exploring systemic causes and developing strategies to address any identified disparities during the Cal-CQI process. This involves analysis of individual level data and emerging themes from the Cal-CSA. The outcomes of previously implemented strategies and their impact on performance are discussed, but specific results or changes are not mentioned in the text. The report also indicates that certain information and questions were not applicable during the 2021-2026 Cal-OAR cycle, suggesting that some aspects of the program or its evaluation may have changed during this period. However, the text does not provide specific details about these changes or their effects."
Section 4. Initial Engagement Analysis,Part 4. System Analysis,70,74,"The report discusses the process of CalWORKs service delivery, from the assignment of Welfare-to-Work (WTW) cases to case managers, to ensuring clients are provided with necessary transportation and child care support. A key change includes case managers starting to schedule their own appointments during COVID-19, a change that will be revisited post-CalSAWS implementation. The report also outlines the detailed process for providing full-time child care support for clients, with a focus on prompt access and continuous service.

Child care payments are made directly to providers based on their rates or the Regional Market Rate, whichever is less. The report describes the process of submitting the Child Care Packet, which is required for child care payment. The use of DocuSign eSignature technology was noted as a method to ensure timely receipt of necessary signatures.

CalWORKs clients are given multiple opportunities to request child care, and the agency promotes parental choice in choosing a child care provider. Transition between the three stages of child care is intended to be seamless. 

Regarding transportation, CalWORKs provides options such as bus pass, mileage reimbursement, and reimbursement for parking costs incurred during WTW activities. Despite some challenges with public transportation, efforts are made to provide reasonable transportation services. Since the onset of COVID-19, Orientation is available virtually and over the phone.

The report also underscores the importance of case managers understanding the individual needs, strengths, and barriers of clients to develop personalized WTW plans. This involves using tools such as the Self-Appraisal form and the Online CalWORKs Assessment Tool (OCAT). 

There are no identified barriers in the process of mailing out bus passes. However, there are significant factors affecting the lack of interest in transit use, including poor connectivity, declining service levels, eroding service quality, and rising fares. Some challenges are faced by regional offices whose clients live in remote areas not accessible to bus lines."
Section 4. Initial Engagement Analysis,Part 5. Practice Changes to Consider,75,76,"The report suggests several changes to improve performance in the CalWORKs program in Orange County. These include improvements in caseworker training, barrier removal services, and Welfare-to-Work (WTW) engagement and activity sequencing. The report suggests that more in-depth assessments are needed to detect complex barriers to employment such as mental health issues, drug and alcohol addictions, domestic violence, and learning problems. Once identified, clinical diagnoses and treatment plans can be created so that participants receive appropriate services. 

The Agency is planning to examine all processes related to getting CalWORKs families into a healthier state of mind and creating more thorough and tailored paths to self-sufficiency. The hypothesis is that these improvements will lead to better education and employment outcomes for Orange County families with long-term sustained self-sufficiency. 

The report also highlights the importance of additional measures to promote engagement. A study found that the increase in engagement only had an effect for about 30 days, suggesting that more intervention may be needed to sustain increased ongoing engagement. To reengage CalWORKs clients, one effective method was sending out an additional notice highlighting the potential losses participants might experience by not attending their reengagement appointment. 

Overall, the report suggests that more detailed assessments, continuous engagement, and individualized service plans may improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the CalWORKs program in Orange County."
Section 4. Initial Engagement Analysis,Part 6. Partner and Collaborator Feedback,77,79,"The key trends identified in the Partner and Collaborator Feedback section of the CalWORKs report show that the implementation of the Early Engagement Project and the Client Engagement System (CES) have contributed to successful Initial Engagement performance measures. Despite this success, challenges were identified such as the quick connection of clients to services without obtaining proper documentation and the need for more case manager training to detect distress in families and increase awareness of available resources. 

The feedback also highlighted the necessity of conducting a holistic family assessment to remove barriers and address complex socio-economic and cultural challenges. Orange County, which ranks among the top three in these performance measures, expressed interest in collaborating with high-performing counties. 

Feedback from focus groups indicated that reminders prior to scheduled appointments, access to childcare and transportation, and supportive services early in the process are linked with positive performance trends. However, there was noted concern about clients inappropriately assigned to initial activities without a thorough root cause analysis and family-centered care approach. 

The report also emphasized the importance of strength-based case management, early engagement, and flexibility. Barriers like lack of childcare, reliable transportation, and homelessness were identified as significant issues impacting the maintenance of Work and Training (WTW) appointments. 

The Agency has not yet finalized any targeted improvement strategies, though partners and collaborators agreed with the themes and recommendations provided. Further review and analysis is planned for Spring 2023 to identify targeted areas for improvement."
Section 5. Ongoing Engagement Analysis,Part 1. Ongoing Engagement Analysis,80,81,"The Ongoing Engagement Analysis for the CalWORKs program in Orange County suggests a few trends. The county's Sanction Resolution Rate, Engagement Rate, and Sanction Rate were all higher than the statewide averages during the specified analysis periods. The Sanction Resolution Rate peaked at 15% in September 2021 and dipped to a low of 11.7% in December 2021, with the period witnessing an initial rise followed by a slight decrease. The Engagement Rate reached a high of 49.7% in May 2021 and a low of 43.1% in July 2021, with a slight downward trend observed during the period. The Sanction Rate peaked at 17.5% in December 2021 and hit a low of 12.3% in November 2021, with minimal variation until a rise in December 2021. 

The CalWORKs Welfare-to-Work (WTW) program in the county uses a Client Engagement System to track unassigned cases and under-engaged clients. Proactive engagement strategies are encouraged, and barriers to WTW Engagement are evaluated at various stages. Supportive services are offered, and education regarding the benefits of WTW participation is provided to clients. 

A significant change in service delivery came with the swift transition to virtual platforms due to COVID-19, which presented challenges but allowed service continuity. The county has implemented strategies to increase WTW Engagement Rate, reduce the Sanction Rate, and increase the Work Participation Rate."
Section 5. Ongoing Engagement Analysis,Part 2. Demographic Analysis,82,83,"The CalWORKs report has identified disparities in the program, particularly regarding communication and connections to proper activities. These disparities create barriers for first-time clients, with complex challenges, navigating the program. However, ongoing meetings, collaborative problem-solving practices, and enhanced case manager training are improving communication. Participants have expressed that more options for educational activities, vocational training, and certificate programs for in-demand jobs would increase client motivation.

The report analyzed the Sanction Rate, Sanction Resolution Rate, and Engagement Rate performance measures for six months in 2021. It was observed that transportation and child care issues often hinder clients' readiness to access services.

There were disparities in both Sanction and Engagement rates among different case types and sanctioned types. Notably, the Sanction Rate of the 'Unidentified' case type was 67.1% higher than the aggregate rate, and their Engagement Rate was 19.4% lower. The Sanction Resolution Rate for the 'Long-Term Sanction' subgroup was 7.5% lower than the aggregate. The report also noted disparities in the Sanction Rate among races, with Native American/Pacific Islander clients having a 10.7% higher rate than the aggregate.

The Cal-OAR Team plans to explore systemic causes for these disparities and develop strategies to address them. The report did not identify changes or trends since the last Cal-OAR process, as it was not applicable during this cycle."
Section 5. Ongoing Engagement Analysis,Part 3. Outcome Analysis,84,84,"The report indicates that the Agency is committed to providing equitable services to all clients and has policies and processes in place to ensure this. These include case and quality assurance review processes to detect any issues. There have been no known disparities between the services provided by the Agency, although there may be variations in services available at each of the CalWORKs/Workforce Training (CW/WTW) offices based on capacity and population needs. 

The Agency has plans to conduct further assessments to compare the engagement activities it offers with the services available in the community and to determine if there are disparities among various measures and subpopulations. This assessment will inform the ongoing development of strategies to address any identified disparities through the Cal-CQI process.

The Cal-OAR Team will also analyze individual level data from the Cal-OAR 19 reports and will hold discussions with focus groups and partners to explore systemic causes of any disparities and to develop meaningful strategies to address them. 

The text, however, does not provide any specific numerical trends or changes in service usage, performance metrics, or population trends in the CalWORKs program. The report also notes that certain performance measures were not applicable during the 2021-2026 Cal-OAR cycle."
Section 5. Ongoing Engagement Analysis,Part 4. System Analysis,85,89,"The CalWORKs program has implemented several strategies to improve service delivery and client engagement. These include training case managers to better engage with clients, particularly around the Welfare to Work (WTW) Plan and other activities. Initial case planning includes an interview and a WTW orientation within five business days from first contact. The agency uses the Case Accuracy Review System (CARS) and the Client Engagement System (CES) to review case actions and identify unengaged and under-engaged clients. 

The report notes the use of a Domestic Abuse Waiver (DAW) for clients whose domestic abuse situations prevent them from fully participating in WTW activities. Case managers are required to initiate referrals for services to specialized units, and WTW plans are tailored to meet the needs of the individual and modified as necessary. 

Family Stabilization (FS) services are offered to clients experiencing a destabilizing crisis or situation. If a client accepts these services, case managers complete a referral and transfer the case to a specialized case manager for program evaluation and case maintenance. 

The report also discusses the CalWORKs Home Visiting Program (HVP), which offers coaching in prenatal and postnatal care and helps families transition into WTW activities and employment. 

Exempt clients and volunteers are encouraged to participate in the WTW program, with an emphasis on supportive services including child care, transportation, and ancillary. A system is in place for re-engaging clients who are in financial sanction, with efforts made to contact the client and discuss the benefits of participating in the WTW program. 

Overall, the CalWORKs program demonstrates a comprehensive approach to client engagement and support, with strategies to address barriers to participation and processes in place to ensure quality service delivery."
Section 5. Ongoing Engagement Analysis,Part 5. Practice Changes to Consider,90,91,"The CalWORKs county report outlines planned practice changes to improve the Family Support Assessment (FSA) process, which aims to promote the well-being and self-sufficiency of CalWORKs families. The agency is considering changes based on the Engagement Rate, Sanction Rate, and Sanction Resolution Rate, as well as other performance measures.

The report identifies a need for improvement in caseworker training, barrier removal services, and WTW engagement and activity sequencing. The FSA process, implemented in July 2022, uses a holistic approach to assist families in identifying needs, overcoming barriers, and promoting self-sufficiency, and includes a Family Support Team (FST) to monitor progress for up to 12 months.

The report also notes the need to study both strong and underperforming demographic groups to identify opportunities for improvement and drivers of success, and to prevent program re-entries. It cites studies indicating that fully sanctioned TANF recipients are more likely to return to TANF than unsanctioned recipients, and suggests best practices including integrated case management, automated tracking systems, and frequent client-staff contact.

In terms of service changes, the agency is looking to encourage caseworkers to refer families to FSA when needs arise in areas such as domestic, mental, or substance abuse services; housing and homeless resources; and general safety concerns or legal issues. The report also discusses the importance of collaboration between the CEES and WTW case manager to ensure clients' supportive service needs are met when they agree to cure their sanction."
Section 5. Ongoing Engagement Analysis,Part 6. Partner and Collaborator Feedback,92,94,"The CalWORKs report highlights several key trends and changes in service delivery. The feedback from partners and collaborators suggest that efforts to improve client engagement and reduce sanctions have been successful, with measures like the Family Support Assessment (FSA) being effective in assisting clients to navigate service networks. The report also highlights the importance of a strength-based approach and empathy in engaging clients. 

A significant shift noted in service usage is the need for transitional support for clients transferring from community colleges to four-year degree programs, indicating a trend towards higher education among clients. 

Barriers to access include mental health issues, complex family needs, domestic violence, unstable housing, high stress environments, living in poverty, socio-cultural challenges, and lack of experience in accessing services. These barriers highlight a need for further support and tailored services to meet clients' diverse needs. 

Performance metrics indicate a higher than average sanction rate in Orange County, which is currently under review by the Cal-OAR team. The report suggests the need for a more simplified process to cure Welfare-to-Work (WTW) sanctions that is flexible and tailored to client needs.

In terms of population trends, the report suggests the importance of case managers developing supportive relationships with clients to facilitate engagement and motivation. 

Lastly, the report indicates that further review and analysis are needed to identify targeted areas for improvement in the coming months."
Section 6. Supportive Service Analysis,Section 6. Supportive Service Analysis,95,94,
Section 7. Education Analysis,Section 7. Education Analysis,95,95,"The report does not provide any specific details or data on the CalWORKs-related trends, service changes, or quantitative outcomes in the 'Section 7. Education Analysis' as well as 'Section 6. Supportive Service Analysis' during the 2021-2026 Cal-OAR cycle. Therefore, it is not possible to summarize any shifts in service usage, access barriers, performance metrics, or population trends based on this text."
Section 8. Employment and Wages Analysis,Part 1. Employment and Wages Analysis,96,99,"The CalWORKs report for Orange County showed several trends in employment rate, wage progression, and post-CalWORKs employment rate. The median earnings for those exiting the program between Oct 2019 to Sep 2020 remained steady except for a spike in the April to June 2020 exit quarter. The employment rate for Orange County and California showed minimal variation, with the highest being in the July to September 2021 period. 

For those exiting between April 2020 to March 2021, Orange County's median earnings at PQ 2 and PQ 4 trended upward, while the state's median earnings at PQ 4 trended downward. The Post CalWORKs Employment Rate for Cohort 2 for Orange County reflected an upward trend at PQ 2, but a downward trend was observed at PQ 4 and PQ 2 for the state's rate. 

However, the data might be skewed due to the impact of COVID-19 and stay-at-home orders on the travel and tourism industries prevalent in Orange County. 

The report also highlighted an increasing housing wage in Orange County, which could pose challenges for clients in securing ""housing wage"" employment. The agency plans to prioritize the removal of barriers and support skill building, education, and employment activities to help clients secure better-paying jobs. It was noted that success for Orange County WTW participants is correlated with their educational and vocational achievements. The report suggests that for self-sufficiency, Orange County CalWORKs clients would need to earn approximately $75,529 per year."
Section 8. Employment and Wages Analysis,Part 2. Demographic Analysis,100,101,"The Demographic Analysis section of the CalWORKs county report highlights disparities within different population subgroups, including race, language, and gender. 

Race/Ethnicity: The Wage Progression for clients who identified as Asian, White, and Black was lower compared to Hispanic and ""Other Race/Ethnicity"" counterparts in Cohorts 1 and 2. Moreover, Whites had an Employment Rate of 24.5%, which was 6.8% lower than the aggregate rate. Post-program employment rates for Asians and Whites were also lower than the average.

Language: Spanish and ""Other Language"" speaking clients in Cohort 1 for PQ4 had lower than average wage progression. Their Employment Rate was also lower than the aggregate. The same trend was observed for Post CalWORKs Employment Rate.

Gender: Female clients had lower wage progression than male clients. However, female clients maintained a slightly higher Post CalWORKs Employment Rate than male clients.

AU Type: Clients in Cohort 1 for PQ4 with case types Non-MOE and TANF Timed-Out demonstrated lower than average wage progression.

The report points out that no disparities were related to AU type or gender in employment rates, but disparities were observed when analyzing data by AU type, gender, language, and race for wage progression. 

The Cal-OAR Team is yet to identify the contributing factors to these disparities but plans to continue exploring systemic causes and developing strategies to address them. All clients are engaged in employment and/or educational activities, assessed for barriers, and connected to barrier removal services when appropriate. However, there may be variations in services available at different CW/WTW offices due to capacity and population needs. Further comparative analysis and investigation are needed to assess potential disparities."
Section 8. Employment and Wages Analysis,Part 3. Outcome Analysis,102,102,"The report indicates that the agency has been actively working to reduce observed disparities by providing equitable services to all populations, with a particular focus on community empowerment and promotion of equitable outcomes. The Cal-OAR team is committed to identifying and understanding systemic causes of these disparities and developing strategies to address them during the Cal-CQI process. This analysis will be informed by individual-level data from the Cal-OAR 19 reports, as well as emerging themes from the Cal-CSA. The report does not provide specific details on service usage shifts, access barriers, performance metrics, or population trends, as these areas are noted to be not applicable during the 2021-2026 Cal-OAR cycle."
Section 8. Employment and Wages Analysis,Part 4. System Analysis,103,104,"The CalWORKs program in the county is primarily focused on transitioning adults receiving cash aid from dependency to self-sufficiency. This is achieved through employment-focused and training activities, which lead to unsubsidized employment. Programs offered include Vocational Training (VT) and Subsidized Employment (SE), provided through various contracted partners.

VT is a post-assessment, transitional, and short-term training activity tailored towards growth-oriented or high-demand fields. It prepares participants for specific trades or vocations. The case manager and contracted provider work with each client to assess needs and career goals and arrange an appropriate VT program.

SE provides clients with little or no work history the opportunity to gain soft skills and build workplace confidence through paid employment at public, private, or non-profit worksites. This increases their chances of securing Unsubsidized Employment after the SE period ends.

Additionally, the Welfare-to-Work (WTW) program refers clients to Vocational Education Activities including Adult Basic Education, English as a Second Language, General Education Development (GED) Academy, GED Preparation, and others for career and wage progression.

In 2021, 32% of the total activities of WTW enrollees were Unsubsidized Employment, 1% were SE, and 3% were self-employment. Case managers play a crucial role in assessing each client's employability and identifying barriers to employment. They update and maintain plans to help clients increase income and self-sufficiency. Services provided by case managers include coaching, mentoring, assessing individual goals, identifying service needs, and coordinating case conferences."
Section 8. Employment and Wages Analysis,Part 5. Practice Changes to Consider,105,108,"The CalWORKs report highlights several significant trends, changes, and outcomes. A key finding reveals that the minimum wage required for a worker to afford a median-priced apartment in Orange County increased by 5.8% to $36.31 per hour or $75,529 per year, indicating that minimum wage jobs are not viable for long-term success for the county's CalWORKs clients. 

There has been a shift in service provision as of 2023 with the introduction of Employment Support and Post-Aid Supportive Services (ES PASS) to assist with needs such as transportation, housing, and childcare, and to support job retention for up to 12 months post-aid. Before this, the only Post Aid service provided was child care.

The report also emphasizes the strong correlation between educational attainment and median earnings, with higher education levels also linked with lower poverty rates. However, it was found that 45% of the Agency's CalWORKs clients who completed an appraisal in 2021 only had a high school degree, and 20.9% had less than a high school degree.

To address the barriers to employment and promote self-sufficiency, the Agency has developed Integrated Job Services (IJS), which includes Employment Services, Employment Support and Post-Aid Supportive Services, and Subsidized Employment/Vocational Training Services. The implementation of IJS has streamlined the provision of employment services to Welfare-to-Work participants and improved both internal and external communication.

The report also suggests the potential benefits of transitional job programs as a bridge to unsubsidized employment and emphasizes the importance of education and training in skills demanded in the local labor market."
Section 8. Employment and Wages Analysis,Part 6. Partner and Collaborator Feedback,109,110,"The Partner and Collaborator Feedback section of the CalWORKs county report revealed several key trends and changes in the delivery of the CalWORKs program. The feedback emphasized the need for clients to achieve self-sufficiency through job placement with a sufficient salary. However, the focus group participants agreed that educational attainment levels of clients need to be improved to meet this objective. 

There is an increased emphasis on promoting English as a Second Language (ESL) and Subsidized Employment to aid in smoother transitions to unsubsidized jobs. Participants also noted that many clients find the process of applying for college lengthy and complex, indicating access barriers that need to be addressed. They called for more intensive case management with a holistic approach at the initial stages to lead clients to more suitable activities. 

The feedback also pointed out that due to lack of education, many CalWORKs clients end up in minimum wage jobs that are insufficient to cover basic expenses given the high cost of living in the area, leading to unstable employment and potential homelessness. The need to address various barriers before engaging clients in Welfare-To-Work (WTW) activities was highlighted, including the provision of child care and transportation. 

The feedback supports the development of a tailored WTW plan that assesses the client's educational level, job history, and skill set to assign them appropriate activities. It was also noted that family dynamics often correlate with the successful engagement of clients in an Employment or School Activity, and barriers such as domestic abuse, mental health issues, substance abuse, homelessness, and sociocultural challenges need to be addressed. 

Finally, it was found that when case managers establish a high trust relationship with clients, success rates increased. The Agency has not yet finalized any targeted improvement strategies, but they agreed with the themes and recommendations provided in this section and will conduct further review and analysis to identify areas for improvement."
Section 9. Exit and Reentries Analysis,Part 1. Exit and Reentries Analysis,111,112,"The report indicates that the rate of program re-entries after exit with earnings in Orange County was generally higher than the statewide average, with a high of 16.2% in Q4 2019 and a low of 8.6% in Q2 2020. However, it trended downward from Q4 2019 to Q3 2020. Similarly, the rate of exits with earnings was also higher than the statewide average, peaking at 46.7% in Q3 2021 but experiencing an initial decrease in Q1 2021. 

The rate of program re-entries was lower than the statewide average and also trended downward from Q4 2019 to Q3 2020. These performance measures experienced significant fluctuations due to the impact of COVID-19. 

Factors that contributed to these performance measures include stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits, which made low-wage employment less attractive. Other factors include the loss of housing assistance upon exiting the program, which created additional stress for clients. 

Post Aid services offered through ES PASS were identified as a potential solution to these challenges, providing transitional assistance with housing, childcare, transportation, and other life skills to improve performance measures. 

The report also revealed that 75% of participants in the Caseworker Focus Group agreed that clients who exit the CalWORKs program often return within 12 months due to a lack of post-aid services. 

Service delivery and the availability of services have been impacted by these trends and changes, although the specific impacts were not outlined in the provided text."
Section 9. Exit and Reentries Analysis,Part 2. Demographic Analysis,113,113,"The Cal-OAR Team's demographic analysis revealed several disparities among different subpopulations within the CalWORKs program. The Rate of Program Re-entries for Black clients was found to be 9% higher than the aggregate rate, although the sample size was small. Disparities were also observed in the Rate of Program Re-entries and Rate of Exits with Earnings when data was analyzed by race, Assistance Unit (AU) type, and primary language. 

There were no disparities found when analyzing data by gender. The Rate of Exits with Earnings for Non-MOE and Two Parent cases was 5.6% lower than the aggregate rate. Clients whose primary language was listed as ""Other Language"" had a Rate of Exits with Earnings 11.5% lower than the aggregate rate. 

Similarly, clients who identified as ""Other Race/Ethnicity"" and White had a Rate of Exits with Earnings respectively 5.2% and 8% lower than the aggregate rate. Despite these findings, the Cal-OAR Team did not identify any contributing factors to the rate variations and will continue to explore systemic causes and develop strategies to address these disparities."
Section 9. Exit and Reentries Analysis,Part 3. Outcome Analysis,114,114,"The Orange County CalWORKs program is working towards ensuring all clients are engaged in employment and/or educational activities and are assessed for barriers, with removal services offered where appropriate. The County Welfare Departments (CWD) have established policies and procedures for equitable service provision, with case and quality assurance reviews in place to identify potential issues. While no known disparities have been identified within the services provided, variations may exist between different CalWORKs offices, based on capacity and population needs.

The agency aims to reduce any observed disparities and promote equitable outcomes. To achieve this, the Cal-OAR Team is investigating systemic causes of potential disparities and developing strategies to address them. Further assessments are planned to compare the engagement activities offered by the agency with community services, and to explore potential disparities among various measures and subpopulations.

Post-submission of the Cal-CSA, the Cal-OAR Team plans to analyze individual level data through the Cal-OAR19 reports, discussing emerging themes with focus groups and partners. No applicable changes are expected during the 2021-2026 Cal-OAR cycle."
Section 9. Exit and Reentries Analysis,Part 4. System Analysis,115,115,"The report highlights several key aspects of the CalWORKs program, including successes, challenges, and service delivery mechanisms. The Housing Support Program (HSP) is noted for providing post-aid services, such as continued rental assistance and housing support to clients whose aid has been discontinued due to exceeding income limits. However, to receive these services, clients must have been connected to HSP before leaving aid. The agency is planning to enhance the utilization and connections to HSP during the Cal-CQI process.

The Home Visiting Program (HVP) is another service emphasized in the report. It provides voluntary, high-quality, home visiting services to support the health, development, and well-being of pregnant and parenting individuals. The program's long-term goals include promoting self-sufficiency, supporting the development of children living in poverty, and preparing parents for employment.

Child care is the only post-aid service currently provided to clients who exit the program with earnings. Employed former clients can apply for child care services during their 24 months of post-aid eligibility.

The report does not provide further information on any shifts in service usage, access barriers, performance metrics, or population trends. It also states that no previous Cal-SIP strategies will be considered for the 2021-2026 Cal-OAR cycle."
Section 9. Exit and Reentries Analysis,Part 5. Practice Changes to Consider,116,117,"The report discusses several CalWORKs program adjustments and trends to enhance the employability of Welfare-To-Work (WTW) participants. The agency has developed Integrated Job Services (IJS), which includes three service components: Employment Services, Employment Support and Post-Aid Supportive Services (ES PASS), and Subsidized Employment/Vocational Training Services. The ES PASS, in particular, is designed to assist both current and former WTW participants towards achieving self-sufficiency by addressing basic needs such as transportation, housing, childcare, and additional support for job retention.

The agency is focusing on early inputs in CWWTW and enhancing Post Aid services, recognizing that long-term results depend on various factors. The report notes that one-fifth to one-third of clients who left TANF returned within the following year, particularly those with low levels of education, little past work experience, and poor health. However, those receiving subsidized childcare, public health insurance, or government help with expenses were less likely to return to welfare.

The report also highlighted the importance of post-welfare services, such as skill-building services and assistance with obtaining other benefits like Food Stamps and health insurance. The implementation of ES PASS is identified as a significant change related to Program Exits and Re-entries. The Cal-OAR Team plans to study this new service rollout to better address the challenges that destabilize families after they leave CW/WTW."
Section 9. Exit and Reentries Analysis,Part 6. Partner and Collaborator Feedback,118,119,"Partners and collaborators of the CalWORKs program provided feedback on the program's measures, indicating agreement with the observed themes and recommendations. They highlighted the need for continued home visits after clients exit the program as a way to assess any arising issues, strengths, and resources. 

The focus groups conducted in August and September 2022 underscored the need for upskilling CalWORKs clients to increase their competitiveness in the job market. They observed that clients often end up in lower-end, temporary jobs, which doesn't help them move past minimum wage jobs. They also emphasized the importance of Post Aid services for a period of six to twelve months in areas such as housing, childcare, transportation, as well as essential life skills training. 

The Agency has not yet finalized any targeted improvement strategies, but ongoing discussions aim to identify specific performance measures to focus on in the upcoming months. Feedback from both partner meetings and focus groups aligns with the analysis conducted by the Cal-OAR Team. 

Orange County expressed interest in collaborating with counties that have strong performance in this category. More in-depth review and analysis will be conducted to identify targeted areas for improvements within the next few months. No specific numerical trends, access barriers, or population trends were mentioned in this section of the report."
