Part of the problem can be attributed to the many layers in the chain of command and the standardized processes that can feel less inclusive. Additionally, having a large workforce of approximately 4,488 approved positions allows for lots of specialization in function which can lead to less familiarity in handoffs, whether it be a case going from intake to continuing or a client being assigned a case manager.  Moreover, due to COVID-19 and the safety and virtual measures that were implemented, line staff are also reporting less of a connection to clients."

The Agency applies a No Wrong Door methodology which states that every Agency door and staff person is the correct location and person to inquire with about any service. Staff are to take time to listen and direct clients through appropriate warm hand-offs. sometimes,this includes starting an application in one office and sending it to another, other times, it includes helping someone understand other governmental processes such as Social Security and Medicare. Clients and members of the public can experience similar levels of services and expertise at every office, even when their assigned worker is not in the office. Our CW/WTW offices follow an Officer of the Day model that schedules select staff to address walk-ins with active CalWORKs cases to ensure same day service."

The process begins with clerical staff issuing an appointment letter to the client with the date and time of their Orientation and Appraisal Interview. Subsequently, case managers receive a calendar invite with the pre-scheduled appointments and are required to confirm availability for both parties within 24 hours. Finally, a day prior to the orientation appointment, EQUUS makes a reminder call. The Agency believes these improvements have contributed to the higher Orientation Attendance Rate (OC: 71.5%, State 53.4%), higher OCAT/Appraisal Completion Timeliness Rate (OC: 44.1%, State 25.4%), and higher First Activity Attendance Rate (OC: 73.3%, State 51.4%), for Orange County compared to the State and similar counties."

Knowing whom to contact and having current information about where answers can be found is an ongoing challenge. A participant from a school, expressed that the recent partnership is not as strong as needed and would like staff to come on- site for a day or two per week.

For example, our Partners and Collaborators highlighted opportunities for revisiting barrier removal processes, enhancing the client-case manager relationship, and increased access and understanding of how to utilize child care and transportation authorizations. The Cal-OAR Team believes that enhancements around these focus areas will lead to an increase in Orientation Attendance Rate and Engagement Rate.

Unfortunately, CalWORKs families often need more support outside of services to the WTW participant. The identified gap exists in screening for and providing services to the whole family, not just those we are engaging for WTW participation. For example, if a new CalWORKs family is not properly assessed for barriers that can be destabilizing the family and the caseworkers are primarily focused on work participation, the CalWORKs family may be suffering due to mental health, substance abuse, or learning needs that have not been properly addressed. As a result, the CalWORKs family is not engaged in WTW or additional services. Similarly, undocumented adults are not being offered employment support activities which are essential to helping them earn a living wage in Orange County."

This collaboration of services is designed to best meet the needs of these families through a streamlined approach that maximizes CalWORKs funding while increasing family empowerment, self-sufficiency, and decreasing the risk of g child maltreatment. In addition to a MC monthly report, Linkages families are identified through a review of CalWIN and CWS/CMS at various points in the case including, but not limited to, initial calls to the Child Abuse Registry, when an Application for Petition is submitted on behalf of a child, when there is a change in the legal status of the child welfare case, and through the FSS MC staff attending and participating in the Child and Family Team (CFT) meetings. The Mutual Client staff attend these meetings to assess for new potential eligibility to CalWORKs services as well as to provide services to existing CalWORKs families."

After enrollment in SAH, individuals are assigned a substitute PO Box and a unique four-digit ID number.

The individual's actual residence address is never entered into any computer system and must be kept in a secure location.
