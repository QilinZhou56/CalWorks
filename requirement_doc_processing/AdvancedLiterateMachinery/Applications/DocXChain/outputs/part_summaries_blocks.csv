The AMII has over 25 years of county experience including general county administration, budget, research, and 5 years leading CalWORKs and Welfare-to-Work administrative teams. One of the two managers retired as an AMII with over 30 years of invaluable CW/WTW experience and returned as an extra-help AMI to support Cal-OAR. The second manager served as the Cal-OAR lead and project manager and brought a broad understanding of county government and project management experience. The SSSII has over 16 years of experience in CW/WTW supporting Homeless Assistance, the Housing Support Program, the Home Visiting Program, Family Stabilization, Child Care, Transportation, Ancillary, WTW, and Educational Activities. One SSSI is a former case manager and Employment & Eligibility Specialist with over 7 years of experience with CW/WTW and another 6 years serving the"
Introduction,Introduction,2,plain text,,"The Cal-OAR's goal is to establish a local, data-driven program management system that facilitates continuous improvement of county CalWORKs programs by collecting analyzing, and disseminating outcomes and best practices. Cal-OAR encourages intentionality in county CalWORKs program design, service delivery models, and activity structure. This provides opportunities for adults to build core capabilities critical to manage adversity, succeed in navigating a long-term career trajectory, and balance the challenges of life, family, and work. Through collaboration and partnership, counties and the state will execute a joint vision for CalWORKs outcomes of interest that propel improvement of county CalWORKs programs."
Introduction,Introduction,2,plain text,,"The first component of the Cal-OAR process is the CalWORKs County Self-Assessment (Cal-CSA), which organizes the performance measures into groups of related measures to support a holistic assessment of the CWD's CalWORKs program."
Introduction,Introduction,2,plain text,,"The County of Orange Social Services Agency (Agency) created a Cal-OAR Team consisting of subject matter experts (SMEs) from within the Family Self-Sufficiency-Adult Services Division (FSS-AS). FSS-AS is one of four major divisions within the Agency and encompasses CalWORKs (CW),Welfare-to-Work(WTW), Foster Care, Adult Protective Services, and In-Home Supportive Services."

Introduction,Introduction,3,plain text,,"One of the methods used to gather partner and collaborator feedback was to establish focus groups. The Cal-OAR Team established and met with five focus groups: (1) educational partners, (2) specialized services providers, (3) caseworkers (including Employment & Eligibility Specialists and Case Managers), (4) EQUUS Workforce Solutions (contracted employment activities provider), and (5) CW/WTW Administrators. The Cal-OAR Team conducted meetings virtually. At each focus group meeting, facilitators presented an overview of the Cal-OAR process and shared performance measure data analyses. Following the presentation, partners and collaborators worked in"
Introduction,Introduction,3,plain text,,"The Cal-OAR Team collaborated with Agency staff which included caseworkers, supervisors, and administrators, as well as Agency partners such as contracted case managers, contracted job services provider, and community college representatives. Engaging current and former clients is an ongoing priority and effort which the team is working on establishing. For this assessment, the Cal-OAR Team utilized data from five (5) months of the Client Satisfaction Survey (July - November 2022), which included 75 responses."
Introduction,Introduction,3,plain text,,"The Cal-OAR Team coordinated and wrote the Cal-CSA report with support from the Agency's Research Team to compile and validate data from various sources, including CalWIN. Additionally, the Research Team sent two representatives to the monthly Cal- OAR Project Action Team (PAT) meetings to collaborate with other CalWIN counties and data leads to help ensure the integrity of the Agency's data"
Introduction,Introduction,3,plain text,,The Cal-OAR Team received guidance from senior leadership and worked with former and current SMEs to answer every question in detail. The Cal-OAR Team verified that policies and procedures were consistent with program expectations and noted any concerns or issues as opportunities for future evaluation.
Introduction,Introduction,3,plain text,,"For the CalWORKs System Improvement Plan (Cal-SIP), the Cal-OAR Team will aim to establish small cohorts of current and former clients to better understand CWWTW barriers and challenges from their perspective."
Introduction,Introduction,3,plain text,,A key priority for the Cal-OAR Team was to ensure a thoughtful community-focused approach while completing the Cal-CSA and throughout the continuous quality improvement process. The Cal-OAR Team obtained feedback from a variety of partners and collaborators to help ensure that multiple perspectives were included.

Introduction,Introduction,4,plain text,,"The Cal-OAR Team also facilitated internal virtual meetings with CWWTW SMEs, administrators, and various levels of CalWORKs staff to gather feedback and insight. The feedback provided by various partners and collaborators was used to inform the Cal-CSA process and provide insight into ways in which the Agency can incorporate suggestions and start planning for the Cal-SIP."
Introduction,Introduction,4,plain text,,"The Cal-OAR Team supported the effort to gather feedback from clients by promoting the Client Satisfaction Survey (CSS) created by CDSS. Flyers promoting the survey were distributed to clients to promote the completion of the survey as well as messaging to caseworkers to help explain the purpose of the CSS and how to complete it. Additionally, the team plans on reaching out to clients who have selected that they wish to be contacted regarding the survey to continue engagement through focus groups and surveys."
Introduction,Introduction,4,plain text,,"The Cal-OAR Team was pleased to learn that most partners and collaborators were willing and excited to participate in discussions surrounding various areas of the CWWTW program, barrier removal services, drivers of success, and pain points within the program. A few takeaways from this process include:"
Introduction,Introduction,4,plain text,,Focus group participants enjoyed being consulted for potential  program improvements and opportunities in service delivery and are looking forward to seeing new implementations related to their feedback.
Introduction,Introduction,4,plain text,,". When first engaging with stakeholders, it is beneficial to provide education regarding Cal-OAR, the Cal-OAR continuous quality improvement (CQI) process, how performance measures are determined, and how to interpret performance measures. While Cal-OAR is a data-driven process, CWWTW is multi- dimensional and requires a thorough and thoughtful understanding of how services are delivered to vulnerable families and whether or not families are ready to receive them."

Additionally, having a large workforce of approximately 4,488 approved positions allows for lots of specialization in function which can lead to less familiarity in handoffs, whether it be a case going from intake to continuing or a client being assigned a case manager.

The Agency applies a No Wrong Door methodology which states that every Agency door and staff person is the correct location and person to inquire with about any service. Staff are to take time to listen and direct clients through appropriate warm hand-offs. sometimes,this includes starting an application in one office and sending it to another, other times, it includes helping someone understand other governmental processes such as Social Security and Medicare. Clients and members of the public can experience similar levels of services and expertise at every office, even when their assigned worker is not in the office.

Section 1. Agency Characteristics,Part 5. Financial/Material Resources,34,plain text,,"Based on recent unprecedented events, the Agency cannot make assumptions on how changes in recent allocations would impact future performance. However, based on history prior to COVID-19, the Agency would like to acknowledge the difficulty created by large fluctuations in the CalWORKs allocations. Rapid changes in the CalWORKs allocations create a situation where the Agency cannot adapt quickly to changes and develop a core foundation of services. The challenge is that counties have trouble ramping up fast enough when monies come in (i.e. underspending in last few years). But when caseloads go down, the allocation is cut so dramatically that the Agency decimates programming and services. Then, when resources are needed again due to changes in circumstances, the Agency must re-build infrastructure."

The meeting is planned for March 2023. The Team recognizes our stakeholders' critical role in developing this County Self-Assessment, and we value the insights shared through engagement."
Section 2. Partner and Collaborator Engagement and Feedback,Part 1. Overall Partner and Collaborator Engagement,39,plain text,,"To identify the Agency's partners, the Cal-OAR Team reviewed guidance from ACL 19-108 which requires for CWDs to collaborate with County CW administrators, supervisors, and caseworkers; current and former clients; and agency partners. Additionally, ACL 19-108 suggests CWDs collaborate with community colleges, tribal organizations, local Workforce Development Boards (WDBs), adult education providers, and domestic abuse services providers."

The participants stated that the quarterly meetings and the education consortium have been helpful in better understanding regulations and making personal connections. Designating a liaison at regional offices has been beneficial. Contact points at each regional office have significantly improved communication and access to information.
Section 2. Partner and Collaborator Engagement and Feedback,Part 1. Overall Partner and Collaborator Engagement,40,plain text,,"Focus group participants had been employed in the field for multiple years (5-20 years) and agreed that the Agency has steadily worked to improve the relationship with them, especially in recent years. The participants described the Agency as ""open to feedback' and willing to work with partners to solve problems or miscommunications."
Section 2. Partner and Collaborator Engagement and Feedback,Part 1. Overall Partner and Collaborator Engagement,40,plain text,,"Most participants reported that the students they receive are a good fit, especially for those enrolling in non-graded courses, e.g., English as a Second Language (ESL), General Educational Development (GED), and high school (HS) diploma programs. The participants indicated they did not know which students are Welfare-To-Work referrals and having that information would have encouraged more attention to the student and case management. The students transferring from community college to a four-year program do not have transitional support."
Section 2. Partner and Collaborator Engagement and Feedback,Part 1. Overall Partner and Collaborator Engagement,40,plain text,,"Despite the appropriateness of the referral, participants agreed that these students brought them significant challenges, e.g., domestic violence, a history of substance abuse, lack of adequate child care, housing instability, and psychological stresses."

Overall Partner and Collaborator Engagement,40,plain text,,"The second focus group conducted by SVC was for Specialized Services on January 11, 2022, via Zoom. All participants were actively engaged in the brainstorming session and provided excellent feedback."
Section 2. Partner and Collaborator Engagement and Feedback,Part 1. Overall Partner and Collaborator Engagement,40,plain text,,"Educational representatives stated updated training for Agency staff had been a challenge, e.g., CWWTW staff sometimes appears not informed or fully trained when new legislation is implemented. The participants reported that CW/WTW staff sometimes does not acknowledge the expertise of educators in these programs regarding the CalWORKs program and perceive educators as overstepping their boundaries, which impacts students who experience tension between their school counselors and CW/WTW representatives. Knowing whom to contact and having current information about where answers can be found is an ongoing challenge. A participant from a school, expressed that the recent partnership is not as strong as needed and would like staff to come on- site for a day or two per week. Transportation is also a continuing obstacle, even distances as short as a few miles. Although a few miles may not seem significant, for some populations who perceive leaving their community as unsafe, 5 - 6 miles can be a tremendous obstacle."

Section 2. Partner and Collaborator Engagement and Feedback,Part 1. Overall Partner and Collaborator Engagement,41,plain text,,"Participants emphasized the need for regular training for all case managers by the contracted agencies about what agencies can and cannot provide as essential to the effective use of the Agency's services. Incorrect referrals require re-referrals which is exhausting for the client and undermines motivation. An example is referring a client who does not qualify for agency services, e.g., a client without the right to work in the United S States."
Section 2. Partner and Collaborator Engagement and Feedback,Part 1. Overall Partner and Collaborator Engagement,41,plain text,,"Participants recommended that the client referral process should be revised with an emphasis on the client's needs and goals and should be staged, allowing the client to remedy the current crisis before being assigned another goal/task. The referral's order and relevance are essential to the client's success. Inappropriate referrals can result in missed opportunities for clients."
Section 2. Partner and Collaborator Engagement and Feedback,Part 1. Overall Partner and Collaborator Engagement,41,plain text,,"Reliable child care and transportation are another impediment to maintaining employment and housing stability. The participants agreed clients would benefit from not being bounced around between stages in child care. One added complication appears in cases where the client does not have enough CalWORKs time left to complete the program. Additionally, challenges were faced with the onset of COVID-19 among providers as well as clients who were reluctant to utilize licensed child care facilities."
Section 2. Partner and Collaborator Engagement and Feedback,Part 1. Overall Partner and Collaborator Engagement,41,plain text,,"Frequent changes of case managers due to transfers, promotions, or retirements is a challenge for clients who are expected to develop high trust relationships. When staff leave or transfer, there is no provision for transition to the next case manager, which harms the client and the service provider, e.g., if caseworkers do not inform providers that a CalWORKs case is closing. As a result, a plan for post-CalWORKs services cannot be developed."
Section 2. Partner and Collaborator Engagement and Feedback,Part 1. Overall Partner and Collaborator Engagement,41,plain text,,"Homelessness and housing instability are significant obstacles to families' stabilizing and finding employment. Especially in recent years, ongoing client challenges increased by the insufficient number of proprietors willing to accept Section 8 Housing and Urban Development(HUD) vouchers from CalWORKs clients."

Overall Partner and Collaborator Engagement,42,plain text,,"Fifty percent agreed that Bridging activities during college session breaks are not working well. Clients struggle to meet participation hours during spring and winter break. The Non- Compliance process is too lengthy and cumbersome. By the time the financial sanction is imposed, which is not the goal of the case managers, the client is back to school and meeting participation hours; therefore, case managers should be spending that time engaging other clients."
Section 2. Partner and Collaborator Engagement and Feedback,Part 1. Overall Partner and Collaborator Engagement,42,plain text,,"Most clients receiving Advance Ancillary timely before starting school have reported higher client satisfaction and success rate. Seventy-five percent of the participants agree that Advance Ancillary, laptops, parking fees, and mileage are working well. Certificate Programs at Community Colleges and GED and Technical Education/Healthcare through Work Development Boards are trendy and well-received by the clients."

Overall Partner and Collaborator Engagement,42,plain text,,"Cell-Ed (a learning program that enables participants to acquire essential skills through a variety of distance learning courses) is a recent activity implemented in 2021. The perception is that the clients do not gain any benefit and get bored or feel lost, so they stop participating.

Section 2. Partner and Collaborator Engagement and Feedback,Part 1. Overall Partner and Collaborator Engagement,42,plain text,,"There is a lack of emphasis on ESL for monolingual/non-English participants.

Section 2. Partner and Collaborator Engagement and Feedback,Part 1. Overall Partner and Collaborator Engagement,43,plain text,,"Seventy-five percent stated the main reasons clients return to CalWORKs program after exiting the program for over income are lack of retention services. These retention services include housing, mileage, ancillary, lack of support through lifestyle change/stress, and lack of safety net after obtaining full-time employment, which sometimes results in the client being unable to sustain living independently due to the high cost of living in Orange County."
Section 2. Partner and Collaborator Engagement and Feedback,Part 1. Overall Partner and Collaborator Engagement,43,plain text,,"The fourth focus group was with EQUUS, a contracted partner for employment services. The participants of the workgroup agreed that the barriers that prevent the clients from participating are not having all proper paperwork (e.g. Driver's License, social security card) in place, lack of motivation, confidence, professionalism, and interview skills. Additionally, lack of reliable child care has been especially problematic, the risk of or actively experiencing homelessness and not receiving advance mileage are also concerns."
Section 2. Partner and Collaborator Engagement and Feedback,Part 1. Overall Partner and Collaborator Engagement,43,plain text,,"The fifth focus group was with CW administrators to brainstorm the advantages of current partnerships and service gaps. They all agree that existing partnerships benefit everyone. Solid communication and clear expectations exist, however, they feel there is a gap in the collaboration and services provided as most of the partners focus on WTW services. These services should be expanded to non-WTW populations such as undocumented persons and children."
Section 2. Partner and Collaborator Engagement and Feedback,Part 1. Overall Partner and Collaborator Engagement,43,plain text,,"Some strategies they feel can enhance clients' engagement in educational activities are motivating students through bonuses/incentives upon completion and targeted outreach to clients interested in education, such as clients under exemptions. Additionally, enhance communication encouragement and empowerment to see their potential, offer hybrid activities for clients (ESL and vocational training), explore options to get a certification or short-term diploma in the field that they are currently working, or add more educational activities through WDBs, and holistic family assessment and services offering mental health and supportive services for school-age children."
Section 2. Partner and Collaborator Engagement and Feedback,Part 1. Overall Partner and Collaborator Engagement,43,plain text,,"They strongly agreed that the strategies to remove these barriers are to ensure assignments match the current needs. Case managers need to be more aware of client's needs and skill gaps, issue advance mileage and other supportive services before assigning activities and be willing to go the extra mile to motivate clients to accomplish their goals."

Focusing on these performance measures may lead to improvements in the areas mentioned above, including sustained goal achievement and barrier mitigation. For example, our Partners and Collaborators highlighted opportunities for revisiting barrier removal processes, enhancing the client-case manager relationship, and increased access and understanding of how to utilize child care and transportation authorizations.

Unfortunately, CalWORKs families often need more support outside of services to the WTW participant. The identified gap exists in screening for and providing services to the whole family, not just those we are engaging for WTW participation. For example, if a new CalWORKs family is not properly assessed for barriers that can be destabilizing the family and the caseworkers are primarily focused on work participation, the CalWORKs family may be suffering due to mental health, substance abuse, or learning needs that have not been properly addressed. As a result, the CalWORKs family is not engaged in WTW or additional services. Similarly, undocumented adults are not being offered employment support activities which are essential to helping them earn a living wage in Orange County."

MC is the collaboration and coordinated case planning by staff at both Children and Family Services (CFS) and FSS, working together to provide services to families with an active CalWORKs case in an open child welfare referral or case. This collaboration of services is designed to best meet the needs of these families through a streamlined approach that maximizes CalWORKs funding while increasing family empowerment, self-sufficiency, and decreasing the risk of g child maltreatment. In addition to a MC monthly report, Linkages families are identified through a review of CalWIN and CWS/CMS at various points in the case including, but not limited to, initial calls to the Child Abuse Registry, when an Application for Petition is submitted on behalf of a child, when there is a change in the legal status of the child welfare case, and through the FSS MC staff attending and participating in the Child and Family Team (CFT) meetings.

Section 9. Exit and Reentries Analysis,Part 5. Practice Changes to Consider,116,plain text,,"This article found that between one-fifth to one-third of clients who left TANF returned at some point in the year following exit. The article found that those who left TANF who had low levels of education, little past work experience, and poor health were more likely to return to TANF. The study found that those who were receiving subsidized child care, public health insurance, or government help with expenses were significantly less likely to return to welfare (Acs & Loprest, 2004)."

Practice Changes to Consider,116,plain text,,"The report found that those who left welfare had somewhat higher incomes than those who continued to receive welfare but most were still considered to be poor or “near-poor and were more likely to have problems with access to health care. The report discussed the importance of clients having access to post-welfare services such as skill-building services (to help former recipients transition into better-paying jobs) and assistance with obtaining other benefits they may be entitled to such as Food Stamps and health insurance (Miller, 2002)"

Partner and Collaborator Feedback,117,plain text,,"Focus groups were conducted in August and September of 2022 to discuss Employment and Income activities. The participants in these focus groups were eligibility workers, case managers, and EQUUS. Participants in the focus groups highlighted the need for upskilling CalWORKs clients. They identified the need to assist clients in competing in the job market. Often clients find jobs that are a patchwork of ""'lower-end”, often temporary office jobs, answering phones and filing papers which does not transition clients out of minimum wage jobs. Focus group participants highlighted the need to provide Post Aid services as a safety net for at least six to twelve months in areas such as housing, child care, and transportation, as well as basic life skills to better navigate their new environment."
